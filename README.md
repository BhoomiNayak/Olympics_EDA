## 🔍 Key Insights
1. Sport Success Rate Gap
   
Equestrian and Modern Pentathlon have 100% medal success rates (small elite competitions)
Archery ~30% success rate (larger field)
Swimming & Track & Field <5% (massive participation - thousands of athletes competing)
Implication: Niche sports offer better medal prospects for training programs

3. Height Advantage by Sport
   
Basketball athletes average 185-190cm (tallest requirement)
Gymnastics athletes average 160-165cm (shortest requirement)
Weight correlates with height at 0.85+ (strong correlation)
Implication: Sport-specific recruitment should focus on natural physical characteristics

4. Gender Representation Inequality
   
Women represent <40% in most team sports (Football, Ice Hockey)
Women dominate in Rhythmic Gymnastics, Synchronized Swimming (95%+)
Middle-ground sports (Badminton, Tennis) show 40-60% representation
Implication: Underinvestment in women's programs in traditionally male sports

6. Country Performance Clustering
   
Top 5 countries (USA, Germany, Russia, China, France) capture 60%+ of medals
Medium-tier countries show plateauing medal counts (no growth over decades)
Emerging economies rarely break into medal rankings
Implication: Establishing new Olympic powerhouses requires long-term investment

8. Age Strategy Variation
   
Eastern European countries average 27-30 years (experience-focused)
Island nations average 22-24 years (youth-focused)
Implication: Different national sports philosophies on athlete career length

10. Seasonal Participation Disparity
    
Summer Olympics: ~10,000+ athletes; 300+ events
Winter Olympics: ~2,500 athletes; 100 events
Swimming alone accounts for 10% of all Olympic participants
Implication: Resource allocation heavily skewed toward summer sports
